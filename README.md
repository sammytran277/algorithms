## **Purpose of This Repository**

The purpose of this repository is to have a place to organize my notes and exercise solutions on various data structures and algorithms. Some of the code in this repository is modified from what is taught in "Algorithms, Part I" by Princeton University professors Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne on the online learning platform, Coursera.
